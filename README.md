## Assignment 2, Data 607
### Spring 2021
#### Author: Claire Meyer

This assignment sources data from the results of a Google Sheets survey getting ratings of recent films. The data is transformed in SQL and exported to a CSV that is then explored in R. The survey is found [here](https://forms.gle/SC7ceL5dYpXAjFhcA), with results available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GzeBYKKMgy_tedn2w1O4TyebHaKWJbFlaU--sPgChEc/edit?usp=sharing). 

To play around with a new package, I also included a second solution that uses the `googlesheets` R package.
